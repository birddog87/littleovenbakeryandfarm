              Welcome to The Cozy Coop Bakery, a small artisanal bakery located in beautiful Hagersville, Ontario. 
              Our journey began with a passion for creating delicious, wholesome bread using traditional methods
              and the freshest ingredients.
            </p>

              Every loaf is handcrafted with care in our home kitchen, using simple ingredients and time-honored 
              techniques. We believe that good bread takes time, which is why our doughs are slow-fermented to 
              develop rich flavors and perfect textures.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In addition to our artisanal bread, we offer farm-fresh eggs from our own free-range hens. Our chickens 
              are raised with love, given access to sunshine, fresh air, and natural feed, resulting in eggs with 
              vibrant orange yolks and exceptional flavor.
            </p>
